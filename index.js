  question: 'In what year were the Cleveland Browns established?',
  a1: '1946',
  a2: '1963',
  a3: '1952',
  a4: '1950',
  answer: 'A1',
  comment: 'The correct answer is 1946.   Paul Brown, who was once called the \'father of modern football\', was the team\'s namesake and first coach. From the beginning of play in 1946 at Cleveland Municipal Stadium, the Browns were a great success'

  a1: 'Kolar Cadets',
  a2: 'Kardiac Kids',
  a3: 'The Dog pound',
  a4: 'Bulldog Browns',
  answer: 'A2',
  comment: 'The correct answer is Kardiak Kids. While the Browns made it back to the playoffs in 1971 and 1972, they fell into mediocrity through the mid-1970s. A revival of sorts took place in 1979 and 1980, when quarterback Brian Sipe engineered a series of last-minute wins and the Browns came to be called the \'Kardiac Kids\'. Under Sipe, however, the Browns did not make it past the first round of the playoffs.'

},
{
  question: 'What is the name of the Cleveland Brown\'s cheerleaders?',
  a1: 'The Puppy Chows',
  a2: 'The Dukies',
  a3: 'The Dog Pounders',
  a4: 'None of the above',
  answer: 'A4',
  comment: 'The answer is \'None of the above\'.  Due to their old-school mentality, the Cleveland Browns have never had a cheerleaders squad.  The closest they have ever had was an all-girl marching band.'
},
{

  a1: 'The Dog Catchers',
  a2: 'The Dawg Pound',
  a3: 'The Elfs',
  a4: 'The Swaggers',
  answer: 'A2',
  comment: 'The answer is the \'Dawg Pound\'.  According to Hanford Dixon, then a cornerback with the Browns, the Dawg Pound started during the 1985 training camp where Dixon and fellow cornerback Frank Minnifield started the idea of the pound by using the dog-versus-cat relationship between the quarterback and the defense. This attitude carried into the stands at the training camp, where fans started barking along with the players.'
